# tmcheck

This repository contains code and scripts for an automated trademark-checking system used in an ecommerce/RPA pipeline.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to process free-text input (such as product titles or descriptions) and break them into subphrases to check for potential trademark violations.

## Getting Started

More information and setup instructions will be added soon.
